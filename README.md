# TGIF-web-app
TASK: Create a custom JavaScript-based web applications. 
Develop a Congressional tracking web site for Transparent Government in Fact (TGIF), a non-partisan non-profit organization
working to increase the public’s involvement in government.

PROCESS: • Creating a web site that acts like an application program. 
• Collect, manipulate, calculate and display data, using the same programming constructs as apps you download and install.
But unlike apps, there is nothing to install. The code is run within your browser, using data collected on demand from web services.
• Using modern JavaScript technologies, including AJAX, JSON, and RESTful APIs.

CHALLENGE: • Learning JavaScript was steap but after a few days, ones I got the hang of it,
I loved writing functions and get things literaly into motion. 

WHAT I LIKED MOST: • To see myself grow during the process of building tables in JavaScript and using different calculations 
to present the right data.
• To be able to work with dynamic third party. 
• Using Bootstrap and give the application an appealing look at once.
